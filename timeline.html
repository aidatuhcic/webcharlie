    <h1>WEEK NINE</h1>
    <p>The team were introduced to the assignment and started working on possible maps that we could create based on our Collaborative Project. 
    Unfortunately, this project did not have a web aspect and so we thought we might be able to try to use the theme of National parks and try to map the temporal landscape changes seen in 
    this park. We initially wanted to focus on using remote sensing data to display the changes to the landscape in the Haliburton Highlands area. 
    We came up  with our initial problem statement based on this idea but were recommended to try and choose a different area due to a lack of data available for this area. </p>

    <h1>WEEK TEN</h1>
    <p>The team then attempted to think of other parks and this time, we ensured that data for the park was available and GIS tools could be used to clip and only use the required data.
    We went through numerous topics but initially started to look at parks located around Lindsay, Ontario such as the Algonquin Provincial Park. This was too large and other parks that we looked into were smaller but felt by the team to still be too large an area to consider.
    Finally, we found that Rouge National Urban Park would be the best fit. We had a Canadian National Parks shapefile that contained the boundaries of this park and we also found location data about Least Bitterns on INaturalist website which we felt could be used.
    Sadly, this proposal was unusable as we could not use any spatial analysis techniques and had to focus on the Web components and how to best display the map solution. 
    This caused some panic as we tried our best to find a new topic. We once again went through many topics and ideas after looking through the data available on the Ontario GeoHub website. 
    Fortunately, we were able to find a new topic that was slightly similar to the previous theme we had. This related to the locations of black legged ticks in Toronto Parks as we could find data about tick locations and a shapefile of the different parks in Toronto on the Toronto open access website.

    <h1>WEEK ELEVEN</h1>
    <p> This week consisted of a lot of research about black legged ticks and discussions about the possible web solutions that could be used. We initially looked through the ArcGIS Solutions page to possibly find a way to tackle our problem. 
     We also found location data of black legged ticks from previous years.

    <h1>WEEK TWELVE</h1>
    <p>The website was created to display information about our project and the web map solution. We were still working on the web solution and had not displayed this on the website yet
     A group was created on ArcGIS online and all of the relevant data for thw web solution was uploaded here. This was then used and an initial map was also created to just display the data from 2019 using MapViewer. 
     We did want to display data from other years (2015 to 2018) but had not yet found the solution for this issue. Leaflet API was also used to display a map of tick location in Toronto parks in the year 2019. 
     But we still were not satisfied by the capabilities of this and wanted to find a better solution. </p>

    <h1>WEEK THIRTEEN.</h1>
    <p>Seperate maps were made for each year and pop-ups were configured to showcase information auch as the name of the park and the year that the data was collected. 
    A different colour was used for the point data of tick location to make it easier to differentiate between the years. These maps were then loaded on to the Experience Builder website created.
    A button was added to make it easy for a user to display a map corresponding to the year. This also makes it easier to visually differentiate between the years.</p>

    <p>Last touches for the website were added we ensured that all the links were working well. Content was added to the webpage to tell the story of how we came to our present solution.
     The mapbox solution was a last minute addition that was decided upon as this would be easier to diplay on a webpage compared to our Experience builder map. Initially, Map studio was used to display a map.
     This was felt to be an insufficient solution, therefore, the Mapbox GL JS API was used to display a web map solution. Another addition, was that of Kobo toolbox as it made sense to allow users to document and add 
     data about tick location within parks in Toronto.</p>
