    <!-- what is mapbox -->
    <h3>Mapbox Studio.</h3>
    <p>Mapbox or better known as Mapbox Studio is a modern and adaptable service that allows users to design custom web maps for their mobile and web application needs.</p>
   <!-- the good -->
    <h3>The Good.</h3>
    <p>Through my own experience with Mapbox, it was interesting to see that they had an option for users to edit their own datasets within the platform. 
    Personally, I decided to take advantage of this opportunity to experiment with the CSV file that hosted our group's data. 
    I found it easy and remarkable to use, it had multiple options to delete unwanted layers, add new properties to the data and it was simple to undo a common mistake.</p>
    <p>Creating a basic map with Mapbox was also a trouble-free hassle.
    It was interesting to find a multitude of options regarding cartography and how effortless the process of designing various colour schemes were. 
    There were also possibilities for users to import their own text and image/symbology within the map. 
    As well, I think it is important to note that Mapbox has developer friendly API and SDK within their platform, for anyone who wishes to use it to their own benefit.</p>
    <!-- the bad -->
    <h3>The Bad.</h3>
    <p>Even though Mapbox has many fantastic quirks and tools, it is often not user-friendly if the person does not know how to code. 
    There were sections within the platform, which I would have loved to explore, however it requires extensive coding background. 
    Also, Mapbox still has a lack of technical guides for users on how to use or create numerous tools or different sections of the website.</p>
    <p>I also found it quite interesting, that Mapbox subtly likes to market themselves as an open-source platform, however unfortunately they are not, except for their SDK and API being open source.</p>
